# What does it do?
This is simply a water logger to track how much water you drank each day. 

# Why?
- Because I want to learn js. 
- Because I never know how much water I drank.
- Because everyone around me nags me to drink more water, less coffee and sugary drinks.
- Because I'm intrigued by the design philosophy of "Focus on doing one thing only, but do it well."

# What is it tracking?
Each time you click on the big blue "+1" button, it logs the

- timestamp
- cup size (amount of water consumed)

# Ideas to explore?
- Hook onto firebase or something
- User social login
- **Dashboard** with weekly / monthly drinking log, possibly as a graph.
    + Map out the time that the user drinks throughout the day
- Extend for Apple Watch / Pebble Time.
